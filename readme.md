# Coding Challenges

This repository contains my solutions for the weekly coding challenges that aimed at helping software engineers improve through deliberate practice.

These challenges involve building complete tools and utilities from scratch, based on realistic scenarios and applications.

The challenges are available at https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/intro.

## Overview

- Challenges are intended to be completed over 1-2 weeks during spare time
- Each challenge includes an introduction explaining the context
- Relevant background knowledge is provided where needed
- Detailed specifications explain exactly what needs to be built
- Tests and scripts are included to validate solutions

## Getting Started

To start, review the introduction and specifications in the README for each challenge. Background knowledge sections can help ramp up on concepts required to complete the challenge.

Challenges can be completed in any programming language. While my solutions most of them will be in typescript, each will produce the same end result.
